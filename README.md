Azure Technologies Used: Azure App Service , Azure App service VS Code Extension.
Technologies Used in Project: HTML , CSS , JavaScript.

Here are the Reasons I chose Azure App service to Host my Website:
1) Highly Secure Web Apps Development
2) Multilingual and Versatile Framworks like ASP.NET, Node.js, Java, PHP, Python.
3) Global Scale and High Availability
4) Quick Analytics and Actionable Insights

iSound is a hip new website where you can play your favourite songs, it has functionalities like , play/pause , previous song, next song and a seekable progress bar.

Note: I have done this Project on Sandbox because I was having Trouble creating a Azure Student Account, and after weeks of discussion with support@futurereadytalent the issue couldn't be resolved and he advised me to do the Project on sandbox, and I was told to Add all the relevant Screenshots to the Github README and Provide a Project Demo Video, Which i have done so. Here are the Screenshots of the conversation Please Consider.
